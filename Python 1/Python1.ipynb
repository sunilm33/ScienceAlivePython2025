    "## Variables\n",
    "Variables are our <b> bags of holding </b> for storing data values. You can hold all your data in variables in Python.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Here are some rules and outlines for our variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Variables\n",
    "* Python has no command for declaring a variable.\n",
    "* A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n",
    "* Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Variables\n",
    "A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "* A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that variable names are case-sensitive. For example, age, Age and AGE are three different variables.\n",
    "### Data in a variable\n",
    "* The main use case for a variable is to hold some kind of data\n",
    "* In python we mainly use 4 types of data\n",
    "   * Strings - These are how we store words and sentences. Anything surrounded by quotation marks \"\" or apostrophes ''\n",
    "   * Integers - Whole Numbers like 1,2,5,10\n",
    "   * Floats - Decimal numbers like 1.1, 1.5,1.6\n",
    "   * Booleans - The hardest one to understand but it is just True or False values. We need this for anything that requires logic.\n",
    "### Outputting Variables\n",
    "* Python print statement is often used to output variables.\n",
    "* You can combine text and variables."
