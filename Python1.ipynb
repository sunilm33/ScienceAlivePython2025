    "* Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Variables\n",
    "A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "* A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that variable names are case-sensitive. For example, age, Age and AGE are three different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Variables\n",
    "* Python print statement is often used to output variables.\n",
    "* You can combine text and variables."
